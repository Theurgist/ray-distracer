Client-server raytracer made 4 fun purposes only.
It could use lots of cool stuff like message brokers, 
distributed calculations frameworks etc, but it does not.

##### Usage
launch `Client` class to start client app

launch `Master` class to start main server node (Not implemented)

launch `Slave` class to start a calculation node (Not implemented)

##### TODO
- [ ] Distinct optimized and idiomatic versions of rendering engine
- [ ] Loading of some popular 3D
- [ ] Camera manipulations
  - [ ] Dynamic re-render with lowest quality on camera movement
- [ ] Multicore render with dynamic redraw
