Client-server raytracer made 4 fun purposes only.
It could use lots of cool stuff like message brokers, 
distributed calculations frameworks etc, but it does not.

##### Usage
launch `Client` class to start client app

launch `Master` class to start main server node (Not implemented)

launch `Slave` class to start a calculation node (Not implemented)
